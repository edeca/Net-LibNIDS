Net::LibNIDS version 0.1
========================

This module embeds the libnids C library written by Rafal Wojtczuk <nergal@avet.com.pl?.
libnids is designed to do all lowlevel network code required by a network intrusion detection
system (whichis what NIDS stands for). This module uses libnids to allow you to read
the reassembled tcp stream without any duplicates or incorrect order. That is, like a normal
host would have seen the stream.

Note that on AMD64 architecture machines the libnids library must not be compiled with -O2 or
above - compile with -O1 at maximum.  Tests will fail if libnids is compiled with -O2 (no
callbacks are raised by libnids).  See http://tinyurl.com/nh9dych.
